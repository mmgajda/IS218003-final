UX report


In my first design I failed to implement a hero section and I didn’t have a call to action. There was no indication of an archetype shown in this design or any of the methods of persuasion. Here below are the issues I had to work on for the first iteration.

Sebastian 11/29/23
-   need to clearly show the archetype (explorer archetype)
-  call to action (shop now)
-  hero section needed (also work on hero text)
-  consistent colors for the nav bar and the footer, also change the color of the text
-  create a card (have text under the image showing the price for individual items if showcased) (this is for new arrivals)
-  button opacity
-  background opacity 

Here below are the issues of when I did a final iteration of the design
